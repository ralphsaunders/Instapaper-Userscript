From the blog (http://ralphsaunders.co.uk/blogged-about/his-instapaper-userscript/)

For those not in the know, Instapaper (http://www.instapaper.com/) is probably best described as a bookmarking tool.
You stick a bookmarket in your address bar and when you want to save something to read later, you click it and it's 
saved in your Instapaper account. It's damn useful, especially if you're travelling a lot.

The goal of this script was less about aesthetics and more about tidying things up and de-cluttering the UI. By no 
means is it finished, if you want to contribute I'll be setting up a github repository shortly, just drop a comment and 
I'll notify you when it's up.
